 "As researchers are under immense pressure to maintain expertise in their research domains, they have little time to stay current with the latest software engineering practices (...) The lack of career incentives has occurred partially because the academic environment and culture have developed over hundreds of years, while [software has only recently become important, in some fields over the last 60+ years, but in many others, just in the last 20 or fewer years ]{.rn rn-type=highlight rn-multiline=true} (Foster, 2006)."

## Let's see an example


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%" #vcenter}
**Situation 1**

Anne wants to share R code with a colleague

:::

::: {.column width="60%" #vcenter}

![](img/researcher3.png)
:::
::::


---


#### You want to share your code with a collaborator 
In your computer this code is working well

```r
library(readr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)

coffee_data <- read_csv("coffee_data.csv")

coffee_data |> 
  pivot_longer(cols=aroma:moisture,
               names_to="coffee",
               values_to="value") |> 
  ggplot(aes(value, total_cup_points)) +
  geom_smooth(method= "gam", span=0.3, color='purple') +
  facet_wrap(~types_coffe, scale="free_y")
```


---

## But!
### Your collaborator gets an error

```r
Error in pivot_longer(., 
cols = aroma:moisture,
names_to = "types_coffe",
: could not find function "pivot_longer"
```

ðŸ¤” **What could be going on?**

---

## Functions included in a new package version

> `tidyr` package version `0.8.3` does not include `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`
> These functions were added in `tidyr` version `1.0.0`


[This means that code that is working in your computer now **may not work** anymore if you upgrade your packages!!! ]{.rn rn-type=box rn-color=purple}

---

## Computational Environments

Important to capture them to avoid:

* Problems when sharing your code

* That you code breaks with time

```{r error, echo = FALSE, out.width=600}
knitr::include_graphics("img/ErrorManagement.jpg")
```

Characteristics of a computer that can affect the behavior of the work done on it, such as:

* your **operating system**

* what **software** do you have installed

* software **package versions** are installed

#### Tools for reproducibility

We can use different tools to ensure the reproducibility of a project such as:

- Docker
- Package managers
- Create your own package
- Documenting the OS, packages and versions

---

## Situation 2

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%" #vcenter}

Anne has been creating code that is used by other researchers in the lab. What is the best way to share the code with them?

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

![](img/researcher3.png)
:::
::::





---

## Version Control
Widely used tools for software development

- Git

- GitHub

---

## Why Git + GitHub is the best way to share code?

- We can specific names to each code version and go back to particular moment of the code

- Foster collaboration 

- Makes easier code review

- Makes easier code mantainance


---

## Why Git + GitHub is the best way to share code?

- Allows tracking the authorship

- You can turn your project public

- You can have a backup online of your data

:::

---

## Situation 3

A PhD wants to publish the first article. How can she do it in a reproducible way?
Is hte same to publish an article than other code?


---

## Research Compendium

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

1. **Organize files** according to a prevailing convention.

2. Provide **separation between data, methods and results** expressing unambiguously the relationship between the three.

3. Specify the environment 
(+ **reproducibility**).

```{r rc3, echo = FALSE, out.width = 400}

```

:::

---

## Other practices 

- Testing
- Continuous integration / development (ci - cd)
- Develop a package
- Communication with GitHub issues and project boards
- Code review
- Basic computational practices: filenames
- Automation / use of pipelines



---

## High reproducibility doesn't mean that things couldn't fail 
#### What happens when the technology fails?


```{r notfound, echo = FALSE, out.width=600, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/links.png")
```

---

## Some factors affecting **Reproducibility**
- The tools that ensure the reproducibility (Docker, Conda) could change with time
- The software/hardware we use change with time
- The time you have available to invest in the reproducibility of your project


---

## 1 - How the tools that ensure the reproducibility (Docker, Conda) change with time

**Example 1** - [Inactive Image Retention Policy (Nov 1, 2020)](https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/152): DockerHub removing Docker images in free accounts after 6 

---

## 2 - The software/hardware we use change with time

**Example 2** - Mac M1 - Apple silicon chip (hardware) (Oct 2021)


---

## Software mantainance

* Should we provide more than one option?
* Should our code have **maintainers**?

```{r FixingLinks, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width=600}
knitr::include_graphics("img/FixingLinks.jpg")
```

---

## Why is there no career for software developers in academia?

- In 2012, the Software Sustainability Institute (SSI) organized the [Collaborations Workshop](http://software.ac.uk/cw12) that addressed this question.

- The work of the participants and of the SSIâ€™s policy team led to the foundation of the UK RSE association and later to the **Society of Research Software Engineering**

## {Definition}: reseach software engineer

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="70%" #vcenter}
**What do RSEs do?**

Fundamentally, RSEs build software to support scientific research. They generally donâ€™t have research questions of their own â€” they develop the computer tools to help other people to do cool things.

*"I donâ€™t know very much about these particular research fields, so I work closely with the oncologists or neuroscientists or whomever to develop the software thatâ€™s needed."*

## What is a Research software engineer?

Research Software Engineers use expertise in programming to advance research. This includes researchers who spend a significant amount of time programming, full-time software engineers writing code to solve research problems, and those somewhere in-between.
