## Why do you have to listen the next 50 minutes?



- How reproducibility is connected with coding?

- Links to different material, organizations, communities, conferences, articles

---


# Do researchers develop [software]{.rn rn-type=circle rn-color=white}? {background-color="#CDD7D6"}



---

## {Definition}: Research software

- Research software can be anything [from a few lines of code written by yourself, to a professionally developed software package]{.rn rn-type=highlight rn-multiline=true}


- Software that is used to generate, process or analyse results that you intend to appear in a publication (either in a journal, conference paper, monograph, book or thesis).

###  A survey of the state of the practice for research software in the United States

> As researchers are under immense pressure to maintain expertise in their research domains, they have little time to stay current with the latest software engineering practices (...) The lack of career incentives has occurred partially because the academic environment and culture have developed over hundreds of years, while software has only recently become important, in some fields over the last 60+ years, but in many others, just in the last 20 or fewer years (Foster, 2006).

### There are different types of `reproducibility`

- **Empirical** 
- **Statistical** 
- **Computational**: When detailed information is provided about code, software, hardware and implementation details.

#### How the computational environment ðŸ’» is captured could change the experience of reproducing the article

## Computational environment

## ðŸ’»

Characteristics of a computer that can affect the behavior of the work done on it, such as:

* your **operating system**

* what **software** do you have installed

* software **package versions** are installed

## Computational Environments

Important to capture them to avoid:

* Problems when sharing your code

* That you code breaks with time

```{r error, echo = FALSE, out.width=600}
knitr::include_graphics("img/ErrorManagement.jpg")
```

## Reprohack 
#### How **code** and **data** could be organised?

## Hackathon


### Authors 


Send their papers with **publicly available associated code and data**

```{r circulo2, echo = FALSE, out.width=300, fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/circulo.png")
```

### Participants

Attempt to **reproduce published research** of their choice from a list of proposed papers

```{r sub_form, echo = FALSE, out.width=500, fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/selecciona.png")
```


At the end, the participants give feedback to the authors

## An example of a **submitted paper**

## What I find useful to reproduce the article results? 

A clear and detailed description in the `README` of the files/links necessary to run and where they are

## Research Compendium



1. **Organize files** according to a prevailing convention.

2. Provide **separation between data, methods and results** expressing unambiguously the relationship between the three.

3. Specify the environment 
(+ **reproducibility**).

## Open source software

However, both institutions that support research (e.g., universities and national laboratories) and grant-making bodies that fund research (e.g., federal agencies and philanthropic organizations) often fail to recognize the central importance of software development and maintenance in conducting novel research (Goble, 2014)

### How does the existing ecosystem, based largely on the historical practices related to contributions to journal and conference papers and monographs, measure, store, and disseminate information about contributions to software?

 â€¢ How does the existing ecosystem miss information about software contributions?

In some disciplines, such as those where monographs are typical products, there may be no formal guidelines. Author ordering is another challenge. The ordering of author names typically has some meaning, though the meaning varies between disciplines.  S22

## Career paths

Software in general has not been well-cited (Howison & Bullard, 2016), in part because the scholarly culture has not treated software as something that should be cited, or in some cases, even mentioned. S22

---

## RSE Survey 2022: Credit

- The most common approaches are either to *cite a paper about the software* or to *mention the software by name*
- Unfortunately, this practice leads to fewer trackable citations of the software, making it more difficult to judge its impact.

## Why is there no career for software developers in academia?

- In 2012, the Software Sustainability Institute (SSI) organized the Collaborations Workshop (http://software.ac.uk/cw12) that addressed this question.

- The work of the participants and of the SSIâ€™s policy team led to the foundation of the UK RSE association and later to the **Society of Research Software Engineering**
