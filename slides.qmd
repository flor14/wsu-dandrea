- Research software can be anything [from a few lines of code written by yourself, to a professionally developed software package]{.rn rn-type=highlight rn-multiline=true}

 "As researchers are under immense pressure to maintain expertise in their research domains, they have little time to stay current with the latest software engineering practices (...) The lack of career incentives has occurred partially because the academic environment and culture have developed over hundreds of years, while [software has only recently become important, in some fields over the last 60+ years, but in many others, just in the last 20 or fewer years ]{.rn rn-type=highlight rn-multiline=true} (Foster, 2006)."

#### You want to share your code with a collaborator 
In your computer this code is working well

```r
library(readr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)

coffee_data <- read_csv("coffee_data.csv")

coffee_data |> 
  pivot_longer(cols=aroma:moisture,
               names_to="coffee",
               values_to="value") |> 
  ggplot(aes(value, total_cup_points)) +
  geom_smooth(method= "gam", span=0.3, color='purple') +
  facet_wrap(~types_coffe, scale="free_y")
```


---

## But!
### Your collaborator gets an error



```r
Error in pivot_longer(., 
cols = aroma:moisture,
names_to = "types_coffe",
: could not find function "pivot_longer"
```




ðŸ¤” **What could be going on?**

---

## Functions included in a new package version

> `tidyr 0.8.3` does not include `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` functions added in `tidyr` version `1.0.0`


[This means that code that is working in your computer now **may not work** anymore if you upgrade your packages!!! ]{.rn rn-type=box rn-color=purple}

---

## Computational Environments

Important to capture them to avoid:

* Problems when sharing your code

* That you code breaks with time

## How to avoid to have this error?

#### Tools for reproducibility

There are different tools to ensure the reproducibility of your project.

- Docker
- Package managers

---

## Situation 2


A new Ph.D. is starting in your lab. What is the best way to save the code he has created with other members of the group?


---

## Version Control
Widely used tools for software development

- Git

- GitHub

---

## Why Git and GitHub is the best way to share code?

- We can specific names to each code version and go back to particular sections of the code

- We can contribute directly to their repository

- Track the autorship


---



![](img/openresearch.jpg)
You can decide to work in a private repository, but eventually the code could be share using GitHub when the article is published.

---

#### Many research groups have their GitHub organizations online
Sharing all the code produce as part of their research

## Some factors affecting **Reproducibility**
1. The tools that ensure the reproducibility (Docker, Conda) could change with time
2. The software/hardware we use change with time
3. Should your software need to be maintained? Dependencies can change with
4. The time you have available to invest in the reproducibility of your project


---

## 1 - How the tools that ensure the reproducibility (Docker, Conda) change with time

**Example 1** - [Inactive Image Retention Policy (Nov 1, 2020)](https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/152): DockerHub removing Docker images in free accounts after 6 months of inactivity 

---

## 1 - How the tools that ensure the reproducibility (Docker, Conda) change with time

**Example 1** - [Inactive Image Retention Policy (Nov 1, 2020)](https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/152)

**Solutions?**

- Using images from popular repositories (rocker - jupyter - debian - ubuntu)

- Adding instructions in the README about how to build the image from the Dockerfile


---

## 2 - The software/hardware we use change with time

**Example 2** - Mac M1 - Apple silicon chip (hardware) (Oct 2021)

. . . 

**Solutions?**

- Create your Docker images in both architectures

---

## 2 - The software/hardware we use change with time

**Example 3** - One of the dependencies is not available in the official repositories / is deprecated (software)


**Solutions?**

It depends on the next list item...

---

## 3 - How is your project? Is software that would need to be maintained?

**Example 3** - One of the dependencies is not available in the official repositories / is deprecated (software)


**Solutions?**

- Continuous integration for software that you would like to keep updated 

- Always document versions and packages used, so the user can try to find the package from a different source

- ?

---

## 4. The time you have available to invest in the reproducibility of your project

- At least always include the output of `devtools::sessionInfo()` in R of `session_info.show()` in Python.


There could be other valid solutions to all these problems!!!


# Choose the appropriate level or reproducibility workflows/tooling based on project complexity and desired shareability

---

## Software mantainance

* Should we provide more than one option?
* Should our code have **maintainers**?

knitr::include_graphics("img/FixingLinks.jpg")

## Why is there no career for software developers in academia?

- In 2012, the Software Sustainability Institute (SSI) organized the [Collaborations Workshop](http://software.ac.uk/cw12) that addressed this question.

- The work of the participants and of the SSIâ€™s policy team led to the foundation of the UK RSE association and later to the **Society of Research Software Engineering**

Research Software Engineers use expertise in programming to advance research. This includes researchers who spend a significant amount of time programming, full-time software engineers writing code to solve research problems, and those somewhere in-between.
